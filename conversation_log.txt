Project Planning for E-commerce Chatbot with RAG, Fine-tuning, and LangGraph

1. Project Planning
A. Define Project Scope
- Goal: Build an e-commerce chatbot that can answer product questions, recommend items, and handle basic customer queries.
- Core Features:
  - Natural language understanding (NLP)
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for up-to-date/product-specific answers
  - Fine-tuning for domain-specific language and tone
  - Conversation flow management with LangGraph

B. High-Level Architecture
1. Frontend: Chat interface (web or app)
2. Backend:
   - LangGraph for conversation flow/state management
   - RAG pipeline (retriever + generator)
   - Fine-tuned LLM (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
   - Product/FAQ database or vector store
3. Logging: Store all conversations in a text file for review and improvement

C. Key Steps
1. Set up project structure
2. Integrate LangGraph
3. Implement RAG pipeline
4. Prepare and fine-tune the LLM
5. Connect to product/FAQ data
6. Build conversation logging
7. Test and iterate

2. Conversation Logging
- File created: conversation_log.txt (to store all project conversations and planning notes)

3. Dataset Generation Discussion
- User requested comprehensive e-commerce dataset generation
- Need to create:
  - Complete FAQ dataset covering all aspects of e-commerce
  - PDF documents for external RAG sources including:
    - Return/Refund Policy
    - Shipping Policy
    - Privacy Policy
    - Terms of Service
    - Product Catalogs
    - User Manuals
    - Customer Service Guidelines
- Plan to generate synthetic but realistic e-commerce data
- Will create structured data files and PDF documents for RAG implementation

---

4. Dataset Generation Completed
- Created comprehensive FAQ dataset (data/faq_dataset.json):
  - 9 categories covering all aspects of e-commerce
  - 40+ detailed Q&A pairs
  - Professional, helpful responses
  - Categories: Account & Registration, Shopping & Orders, Shipping & Delivery, Returns & Refunds, Product Information, Customer Service, Security & Privacy, Loyalty & Rewards, Technical Issues

- Created detailed product catalog (data/product_catalog.json):
  - 8 product categories (Electronics focus)
  - Complete specifications and features
  - Pricing, ratings, reviews, warranty info
  - Rich metadata for RAG implementation

- Created policy documents (documents/):
  - Return Policy (comprehensive 30-day policy)
  - Shipping Policy (multiple options and costs)
  - Privacy Policy (GDPR/CCPA compliant)
  - Terms of Service (complete legal terms)
  - Customer Service Guidelines (internal procedures)

- Created PDF converter utility (utils/pdf_converter.py):
  - Automated text to PDF conversion
  - Professional formatting with styles
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Command-line interface

- Created project infrastructure:
  - requirements.txt with all dependencies
  - Comprehensive README.md
  - Project structure documentation
  - Installation and usage instructions

5. Next Steps Identified
- Set up LangGraph workflow for conversation management
- Implement RAG pipeline using generated documents
- Create fine-tuning dataset from FAQ and conversation logs
- Build web interface for chatbot
- Add authentication and user management
- Implement analytics and monitoring

---

6. Project Status: DATASET GENERATION COMPLETE
- All requested data has been generated
- PDF documents ready for RAG implementation
- Project structure established
- Ready to proceed with LangGraph and RAG implementation

7. Phase 2: Implementation Planning
User requested to proceed with:
1. Data preprocessing and clean dataset creation for NLP model
2. Multi-agent system implementation
3. Basic LLM and RAG LLM creation
4. LLM fine-tuning
5. Frontend UI development

Implementation Plan:
- Create data preprocessing pipeline
- Design multi-agent architecture with LangGraph
- Implement basic LLM integration
- Build RAG pipeline with vector database
- Create fine-tuning dataset and pipeline
- Develop modern frontend UI with FastAPI
- Integrate all components into working system

8. Current Focus: Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- Clean and structure FAQ dataset for training
- Process product catalog for RAG retrieval
- Extract and chunk policy documents
- Create training datasets for fine-tuning
- Prepare validation and test sets
